Synopsis
========

This is a metadata add-on for [Kodi/XBMC](http://kodi.tv/) which scrapes tvshow information from [serialzone.cz](http://www.serialzone.cz/) and fills the missing media art using [TVDB](http://www.thetvdb.com/).

Background
==========

Version 2.1 of metadata.serialzone.cz scraper is few years old from [LD developer](http://ldevel.blogspot.sk/). As there are no official updates for few years, I have taken last available and modified it for my personal use and decided to go public with version 2.2.

Installation
============

1. Download the [latest version](https://github.com/ekarorgit/metadata.serialzone.cz/archive/master.zip).
2. In Kodi, navigate to *Add-ons* > *Add-on browser* > *Install from zip file*. [help](http://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files)
3. Browse for the downloaded zip file and click *OK*.

The scraper will be probably part of the [cz/sk_repository](https://github.com/kodi-czsk/repository)

Compatibility
=============

All Kodi/XBMC versions starting from XBMC 11 "Eden" are supported.

Disclaimer
==========

Feel free to report any issues with the scraper, though I don't guarantee that requests will be heard in prompt time.
